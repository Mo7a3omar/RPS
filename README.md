# Rock-Paper-Scissors AI Game 🎮🤖

Welcome to the **Rock-Paper-Scissors AI Game**! This is an interactive game that uses real-time hand tracking to let you play the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors against an AI. The project leverages computer vision with OpenCV and Mediapipe for hand gesture recognition.

## Features 🌟

- **Real-Time Hand Detection**: The game uses Mediapipe to accurately detect your hand gestures (rock, paper, or scissors) in real-time.
- **AI Opponent**: The AI generates random moves to compete against you.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Engage in a fun, fast-paced challenge with responsive feedback.
- **Score Tracking**: Track your wins, losses, and draws as you play.
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear and intuitive feedback to show the AI’s move and the results of each round.
